            <h3>Instructions:</h3> 
            <ul>
                <li>The game begins with cards already dealt into seven piles. Each pile has a face-up card, and the remaining deck forms the stock.</li>
                <li>Your goal is to move all the cards to the foundation piles in ascending order, separated by suit.</li>
                <li>Examine the seven tableau piles.</li>
                <li>You can move cards within these piles to reveal hidden cards.</li>
                <li>Identify the four foundation piles at the top. Start building them with Aces, following with 2s, 3s, and so on, up to Kings.</li>
                <li>Draw cards from the stock to the waste pile by clicking or tapping on the stock.</li>
                <li>Use the top card from the waste pile or draw additional cards when needed.</li>
                <li>Move cards within the tableau piles in descending order and alternating colors. For example, place a red 7 on a black 8 .</li>
                <li>Empty tableau spaces can be filled with a King or a sequence starting with a King.</li>
                <li>Move cards to the foundation piles in ascending order and by suit.</li>
                <li>The game is won when all cards are successfully moved to the foundation piles in the correct order.</li>
                <li>If there are no more moves available, and the foundation piles are not complete, the game is lost</li>
            </ul>
